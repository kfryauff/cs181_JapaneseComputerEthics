========================

Taking base set up from a CS 147 Lab (from Spring 2014)

:: Framework ::
Nodejs + Express

:: To Install NodeJS ::
http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs

:: To Run From Terminal (Assuming you ahve Nodejs set up) ::
node app.js

-- NOTE: Projects meaning Pages here --

:: Information Storage ::
projects.json

:: Main Views ::
views/index.handlebars
views/project.handlebars

:: Control Routes ::
routes/index.js
routes/project.js

-- TODO LIST --

PRIORITY :: The information that is stored in projects.json need to be updated.
	:: Information (which is still on the google doc) needs to be fleshed out. I can do the rest of the first part, but could everyone choose a section and work on that?
	:: Please also compile some images to go with your section.

PRIORITY :: We need to get the site onto a server
	:: Max - could you either set us up on Heroku or on your stanford server?

:: If someone is so inclined, perhaps we can break up the information a little better .. so that direction is clear?
